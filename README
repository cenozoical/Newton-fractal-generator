This is the repository for the Newton fractal generator project.

The goal of this project was creating a program which generates a .ppm Newton fractal for the z^n - 1 function using the ispc/C++ languages. The ispc language is used to parallelize resulting image pixels RGB values.

The project was developed on the Ubuntu 20.04 OS. On it, the "ispc --version" command returns "Intel(r) Implicit SPMD Program Compiler (Intel(r) ISPC), 1.28.2 (build commit 5bf8fb90b34122b5 @ 20250924, LLVM 20.1.8)" output. The "g++ --version" prints the "g++ (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.2) 9.4.0" output.

For building/running the project, in the src/CMakeLists.txt file, the value of the CMAKE_ISPC_COMPILER variable has to be set to the location of the ispc compiler. Once that is done, it is enough to run the makefile provided.

The system application was developed on uses the Intel processor with avx2, so for better optimizations, CMAKE_ISPC_INSTRUCTION_SETS variables value is set to "avx2".
